# Notes

1. Components are core concept
2. These components build UI

```
npm install && npm run dev
```

- Need to enter this to get the vite server started

# Note

1. `<script type="module" src="/src/index.jsx"></script>` here you can see it is imported as a `module`, this makes it possible for us to use `import` in the `jsx` file , but it is not deferred here
2. Got SolarySystem from [here](https://codepen.io/pavlovsk/pen/jOjKEJq) - Removed the bg and changed the size with a transform. And placed inside `app.jsx`
3. Props for passing data into components
